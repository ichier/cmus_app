# cmus-remote web app

This is a web app to control a server instance of
[`cmus`](https://cmus.github.io/), a powerful music player, remotely. It supports basic player, volume and mode controls, can fetch and show the albumart-image from current files' folder and display all tags. But you can't add items to the playlist or manage the queue.

If you want to run this web app and cmus itself in backgound and optionally automatically on system-startup check out [`cmus_daemon`](https://github.com/ichier/cmus_daemon)!

## Dependencies

`cmus` is required, of course. The backend is written in Python and has been
tested with Python 2.7, Python 3.5, PyPy 4.0, and Pyston 0.4.

All dependencies are bundled. They are [`bottle`](http://bottlepy.org) and
[`sh`](http://amoffat.github.com/sh/). The frontend also makes use of
[Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/), [Kube](http://imperavi.com/kube), and [Font
Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/). Thanks to the creators
for making them available under permissive licenses. 

## Instructions

The web app can run on the same host as the `cmus` instance you want to control
or a different one, but both hosts will have to have `cmus` installed.

### On the cmus host

- Run an instance of `cmus` using the `--listen` option.

        $ cmus --listen <host>

- Set a password in `cmus` using `:set passwd=<passwd>`.

### On the web app host

- Fetch cmus_app:

        $ git clone git://github.com/ichier/cmus_app
        $ cd cmus_app

- Edit the configuration file. (Optional.)
- Run the app with a configuration file or command-line options:

        $ python app.py -f <config_file>
        $ python app.py -c raspberry -w PaSsWd -a localhost -p 8080

### Anywhere on your network

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://<host>:<port>`.

Enjoy!
